Assignmen 2: SignUpForm
This is a sign up form that has the user input a name, email, password, and password confirmation. If all the inputs are filled then the App will send out a toast welcoming 
use by their name. If the information is not filled in the textbox will send out an error message to the user stating which text box has not been filled out. The password 
and password confirmation will error out if the two do not match.
